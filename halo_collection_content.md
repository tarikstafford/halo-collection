## OUR STORY PAGE CONTENT

### Founders Introduction:
Hello and welcome! I'm Sharona Hurmuses, and together with my husband Jeff, we're the proud co-founders of The Halo Collection—a heartfelt continuation of our journey in hospitality, now rooted in the vibrant neighborhoods of Athens.

### Background - Villa Hurmuses:
For over 20 years, we poured our souls into Villa Hurmuses in Mykonos, creating a place where guests felt not just welcomed, but genuinely cared for. When it came time to say goodbye to that beloved villa, we knew we weren't finished—we were simply ready for a new chapter. And so, The Halo Collection was born.

### Launch Story:
In 2024, we launched three thoughtfully designed boutique apartments and home: The Hive in Kypseli, full of vintage charm and buzzing city life; The Hill, a quiet, cozy nest tucked near the foothills of Lykavittos; and The Silk House in Akidemia Platonos, where creative spirit and old-world textures meet. Each space is a reflection of who we are—warm, stylish, and just a little bit unexpected.

### About Sharona:
My background as a former Singapore Airlines Flight Attendant and Brand Ambassador instilled in me a deep love for service, details, and the power of a personal touch.

### About Jeff:
Jeff brings his Greek-Canadian roots, his builder's eye and his calm, grounded energy to everything we do. With a meticulous eye for detail and a practical mindset, he ensures each project is not only beautiful but thoughtfully executed from the ground up.

### Family:
We're also parents to three incredible daughters, which keeps life full, fun, and wonderfully unpredictable.

### Mission Statement:
We've created homes that welcome guests not just as visitors, but as friends. Whether you're here for a weekend escape or an extended stay, our goal is simple: to make you feel at ease, inspired, and at home. The Halo Collection isn't just about beautiful places—it's about connection, comfort, and the little moments that make travel magical.

### Closing:
We can't wait to welcome you.
